### **Additional graph: Nederlandse literaire romans van mannelijke en vrouwelijke auteurs (1)**

This graph has also been created using the Stylo Package for R. See Figure 3.1 for more information about the package and the measures.

Figure 6.4 shows no differences in the two main clusters, and the same three novels together form one of the two main clusters. Again, Renate Dorrestein's two novels are each in one of those two main clusters. In the largest cluster, the three novels by Flemish authors (one by Lanoye and two by Mortier) are together in a subcluster. A whole series of cluster analyses gives the same picture, as visualised in Figure 6.4.1.
