### **Additional graphs: Translated Literary novels written by male authors**

These graphs have also been created using the Stylo Package for R. See Figure 3.1 for more information about the package and the measures.

Figure 5.2.1 presents a cluster analysis and Figure 5.2.2 a bootstrap consensus tree of the same three groups of translated literary novels by male authors as in Figure 5.2.

Cluster analysis (**1000** most frequent words). Measure: Classic Delta.

The visualisation of this cluster analysis also clearly shows that books by the same author tend to be most similar to each other. Furthermore, there are no separate branches for novels that received the highest or lowest scores for literary quality or belonged to the middle group. Interestingly, the two novels by Henning Mankell appear in different clusters, as do the two novels by Renate Dorrestein in Figure 4.6 and 4.7.

Bootstrap consensus tree (**100** - **1000** most frequent words, increment 100, consensus strength 0.5). Measure: Classic Delta.

Even if we do a whole series of cluster analyses, the pattern remains the same. Mankell's two novels are both connected to the centre of the graph in the visualisation, which means that for these two books (and the others that are similarly placed in the visualisation), it was not possible to determine which of the other novels the book was most similar to. So they are not most similar in this measurement either.


**Conclusion**

For the translated literary novels by male authors, we see no clear difference in the frequencies of the 1000 most frequently used words between the novels that received the highest or lowest scores for literary quality or belonged to the middle group. Mankell's novels were discussed in Chapter 3 of *The Riddle of Literary Quality*, see Figure 3.5.
