### **Additional graphs: <i>Fifty Shades</i> Trilogy and Suspense written by female authors**

These graphs have also been created using the Stylo Package for R. See Figure 3.1 for more information about the package and the measures.

In Figure 3.4, the *Fifty Shades* trilogy appears very close to two suspense novels by Saskia Noort. It is particularly striking that the trilogy is close to Dutch novels rather than English suspense books by women. The cluster analysis visualised in Figure 3.4.1 gives a slightly different view: Noort is still around, but so are a number of other female authors of Dutch thrillers, and the distance to that Dutch cluster is, as in Figure 3.3.1, the distance to books from the Romance category Delta score 2. In the series of cluster analyses visualised in Figure 3.4.2, that picture does not change. It is difficult to ascertain why in the principal components analysis Noort is closest to the trilogy.

**Conclusion**

The additional measurements nuance the picture that the *Fifty Shades* trilogy partly overlaps with Suspense novels by female authors in terms of word frequencies. What remains fascinating is that the trilogy is considerably closer to Dutch than to translated novels. We do not know who the translators of the trilogy are - do some of them (we do know it was a team) perhaps also appear as authors themselves in the suspense novels analysed?
